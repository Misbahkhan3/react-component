# React Data Dashboard Component

This repository contains a versatile and reusable module for creating a sophisticated data dashboard component using React.js. The component is designed to display various types of data diagrams, including Pie Chart, Stacked Horizontal Bar Chart, and Tree Map. It allows for visualizing asset distribution between equity and cash & equivalents, fund distribution for mutual funds, and top sectors for asset distribution.

## Features
- Implements Pie Chart, Stacked Horizontal Bar Chart, and Tree Map to visualize different aspects of financial data.
- Provides customization options for each chart type to enhance the user experience.
- Supports interactivity features such as hover effects and tooltips for better data exploration.
- Ensures reusability and follows best practices for clean, modular, and well-commented code for easy maintenance and extension.

## Installation
To integrate this component into your React.js project, follow these steps:

1. In the project directory, run:
    ```
    npm install 
    ```

2. Once installed, you can import and use the component in your React application.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
- `npm run eject`: Note that this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project so you have full control over them.

## Use Cases
- **Asset Distribution Description**: Visualize the distribution of assets between equity and cash & equivalents.
- **Mutual Fund Distribution Description**: Display the distribution of earnings for mutual funds among individual investors or unit holders.
- **Sector Analysis Description**: Focus on analyzing the top sectors for asset distribution within the equity and cash & equivalents categories.
